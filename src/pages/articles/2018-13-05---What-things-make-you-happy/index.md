Before we begin you must have asked this question to yourself "What things make you happy". But the question is have you got the answer? Perhaps some of you got the answer but most of you wouldn’t be able to accept it for many reasons. Well, all human actually knows what matters us the most and makes us happy the most, but due to many circumstances, responsibilities, compromises, challenges etc stuffs constrain us to pursue them. These words are actually the hampers we create in our tangled mind to make an easy way to get over it. Nobody can teach you how to be happy; it’s all on your own. But some excellent philosopher set their benchmark of some research or principles to light our way of thinking. For this, I had gone through a lot of researchers. So here are some great philosopher’s interesting researches and principles that actually can change your perspective towards happy life. (sounds promising huh?)


##1, The as-if Principle

Act happier and you will be it. Pretend you’re feeling brave and suddenly you are. Richard Wiseman shows how faking it actually helps you to make it. While we all know how emotions can lead to actions- like the way we smile when we’re happy- what if it works in opposite way as well, What if smiling could make us happy?

This research of Richard Wiseman reveals that “we are what we act”. Running away makes us afraid while standing strongly makes us bold. Smiling of being happy would somehow create the atmosphere of joy and this is what changes our personality differences. This technique helps people to build strong motivating stairs towards their positive self-achievement. For his book, Richard Wiseman collected a wealth of biological and psychological research. He cites a particular experiment in which participants outfitted with facial electrodes (for monitoring) were asked to smile- and actually began to feel happier. On a similar note, Wiseman mentions psychologist Sara Snodgrass at Florida Atlantic University, who discovered that people who take long steps, walk with bounce, and let their arms swing back and forth tend to feel happier than who take small steps and have drooping shoulders.

So, what does this mean? Firstly, we can use as-if principle to help and modify the behaviors that hold us back and by doing this we can change our perception of being happy.

##2, The 90/10 Principle

You probably know, how we react to any situation matters a lot and if you have no idea how your silly reactions can turn into something unpredictable than keep reading it carefully. The 90/10 principle by Stephen Covey, he discovered a rule that will change your life or at least the way you react to situations. According to Stephen “10% of any person’s life is made up of what happens to that person, However, the rest of 90% is decided by how that person reacts to that situation”. A lot of what happens to us in life, we have no control over. But we can control by choosing to respond to life’s events rather than react to them immediately.

Let’s better understand it by an example: You are having breakfast with your family. Your daughter knocks over a cup of coffee onto your business shirt. You have no control over what just happened. What just happened next will be determined by how you react. You harshly scold your daughter for knocking the cup over. You find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school, she missed the bus. You rush the car and drive her to school. Your daughter runs into the building without saying goodbye. After 15minute delay you arrive at your office. After arriving at the office late, you find you forgot the briefcase. As it continues, it seems to get worse and worse. When you arrive home, you find a small wedge in your relationship with your wife and daughter. Why? because of how you reacted in the morning. You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you reacted in those 5 seconds is what caused your bad day.

Here is what could have and should have happened. Coffee splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently say: It’s okay honey, you need to be more careful next time. Grabbing a towel you go upstairs and change your shirt. You grab your briefcase, and you come back down in time to look through the window and see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You arrive 5minutes early a cheerfully greet to staff. Two different scenarios both started same, both ended differently only because of how you reacted.
